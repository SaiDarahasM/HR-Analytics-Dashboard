ðŸ“Š HR Analytics Dashboard â€“ Understanding Workforce Insights

I created this interactive HR Analytics Dashboard to analyze key workforce metrics such as attrition rate, employee demographics, job satisfaction, and department-wise trends.

ðŸ”¹ Tools Used: Tableau
ðŸ”¹ Key Metrics:

Employee Count: 616

Attrition Rate: 15.26%

Average Age: 37

Highest Attrition: Sales Department

This dashboard helps HR teams identify patterns in employee retention and satisfaction, enabling data-driven decision-making to improve engagement and reduce turnover.

Building this project strengthened my skills in data visualization, HR analytics, and storytelling with data.
